# BUG FIX SUMMARY - June 7, 2025

## Issue Resolved
Successfully identified and fixed the NayaPay ride hailing categorization bug mentioned in the original log.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a **duplicate JSON key** in `transformation/rules/bank_overrides/nayapay_rules.json`:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "transfer_patterns": [
      // 7 rules including ride hailing rules
    ],
    "transfer_patterns": [  // ← DUPLICATE KEY!
      // 1 rule for incoming transfers
    ]
  }
}
```

When JSON is parsed, duplicate keys cause the second value to overwrite the first. This meant:
- ❌ The 7 important rules (including ride hailing) were lost
- ✅ Only 1 incoming transfer rule was loaded
- Result: Small transfers weren't being categorized as "Travel"

## Solution
**Minimal fix**: Merged the duplicate `"transfer_patterns"` arrays into a single array containing all 8 rules.

**Files changed**: 
- `transformation/rules/bank_overrides/nayapay_rules.json` (4 insertions, 6 deletions)

## Verification Results
✅ **NayaPay ride hailing**: Transfers under 2000 PKR with "Raast Out" note now correctly categorized as "Travel"
- -800 PKR → Travel ✓
- -1500 PKR → Travel ✓  
- -5000 PKR → Transfer ✓

✅ **Currency conversion detection**: Was already working correctly
- 22.83 USD → 20.0 EUR conversion properly detected ✓

✅ **Cross-bank Ammar transfers**: Still working perfectly
- Enhanced detection with flexible matching ✓

## Impact
- **Zero breaking changes**: No logic modifications, only JSON structure fix
- **All existing functionality preserved**: Complete system verification passed
- **Targeted fix**: Addressed the specific issue without introducing regressions
