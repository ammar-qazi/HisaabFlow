## How It Works

1. **Upload CSV Files**: Drag and drop your bank statement CSVs
2. **Automatic Detection**: HisaabFlow identifies the bank and applies the right configuration
3. **Smart Processing**:
   - Parses and standardizes transaction data
   - Cleans up messy descriptions
   - Categorizes transactions using customizable rules
   - Detects transfers between your accounts
4. **Review & Export**: Export clean, unified CSV data ready for budgeting apps

## Configuration

HisaabFlow uses `.conf` files for flexible, bank-specific processing rules:

**App-wide settings** (`configs/app.conf`):

```conf
[transfer_detection]
confidence_threshold = 0.7
date_tolerance_hours = 72
user_name = Your Name Here

# Category-based patterns applied to all banks
[Shopping]
Amazon.*
Walmart.*
Target.*

[Transport]
Uber.*
Lyft.*
Shell.*

[Food & Dining]
McDonald's.*
KFC.*
Starbucks.*
```

**Bank-specific overrides** (e.g., `configs/nayapay.conf`):

```conf
[bank_info]
name = nayapay
currency_primary = PKR

[column_mapping]
date = TIMESTAMP
amount = AMOUNT
title = DESCRIPTION

# Bank-specific patterns override global ones
[Groceries]
SaveMart
D. Watson
Grocery

[Bills & Fees]
Mobile top-up.*
Cloud Storage

[description_cleaning]
# Clean up messy transaction descriptions
mobile_topup = Mobile top-up purchased\|.*Nickname: (.*?)(?:\|.*)?$|Mobile topup for \1
```

## Key Capabilities
