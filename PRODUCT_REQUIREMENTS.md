# Product Requirements Document: HisaabFlow

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-07-12

## 1. Introduction

HisaabFlow is a cross-platform desktop application designed to simplify and automate the process of preparing bank statement data for personal budgeting applications. It addresses the common pain point of manually cleaning, formatting, and reconciling CSV exports from multiple different banks, each with its own unique format. By providing a powerful, configuration-driven pipeline, HisaabFlow transforms messy, inconsistent bank statements into a single, clean, and standardized dataset ready for import into popular budgeting tools.

The core philosophy of HisaabFlow is **privacy and control**. All data processing occurs locally on the user's machine, ensuring that sensitive financial information never leaves their computer.

## 2. Target Audience

The primary users of HisaabFlow are financially-conscious individuals who:
- Use personal budgeting software (e.g., YNAB, Cashew, Aspire Budgeting).
- Manage accounts across multiple banks and financial institutions.
- Regularly download and import transaction data via CSV files.
- Are comfortable with desktop software and value data privacy.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal:** To drastically reduce the time and effort required to aggregate and standardize bank statement CSVs from multiple sources.
- **Secondary Goal:** To provide a secure, private, and offline-first tool for handling sensitive financial data.
- **User Experience Goal:** To offer an intuitive, step-by-step workflow that guides the user from raw file upload to clean data export with minimal friction, including a guided setup for unknown banks.

## 4. Core Features (Functional Requirements)

### 4.1. Multi-File CSV Upload
- Users must be able to upload one or more CSV files simultaneously via a drag-and-drop interface.

### 4.2. Automatic Bank Detection
- The system must automatically identify the source bank for each uploaded CSV file.
- Detection shall be based on a confidence scoring system using file name patterns and content signatures defined in configuration files.

### 4.3. Configuration-Driven Parsing
- All parsing logic (e.g., column mapping, date format, currency handling) must be driven by bank-specific `.conf` files.
- This allows for easy extension to new banks without changing the core application code.

### 4.4. Interactive Data Preview and Review
- The application must display a preview of the parsed data in an interactive grid.
- Users must be able to review the parsed data and, if necessary, override suggested parsing parameters (e.g., header row, data start row).

### 4.5. Data Cleaning and Standardization
- The system must perform automated data cleaning, including:
  - Standardizing date formats.
  - Cleaning transaction descriptions (e.g., removing redundant text).
  - Converting currency amounts to a consistent numerical format.

### 4.6. Automated Transfer Detection
- The system must intelligently identify and categorize transfer transactions between different accounts.
- Detection should be based on a confidence algorithm that matches transaction amounts and dates across different files.

### 4.7. Manual Transfer Confirmation
- The UI must present users with potential transfer pairs that the system is not 100% confident about.
- Users must be able to manually review and confirm these pairs, improving the accuracy of the final dataset.

### 4.8. Standardized Data Export
- The final, processed data must be exportable as a single, clean CSV file.
- The export format should be standardized and ready for direct import into budgeting applications.

### 4.9. Cross-Platform Desktop Application
- The application must be available as a standalone desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### 4.10. Local-First Data Processing
- All file processing, parsing, and transformation must occur entirely on the user's local machine. No financial data should be transmitted over the network.

### 4.11. Advanced Configuration Mode for Unknown Banks
- **Trigger:** If the automatic bank detection for an uploaded CSV results in a confidence score below a configurable threshold, the system will not attempt to parse it automatically.
- **Advanced Mode UI:** The file will be presented in an "Advanced Configuration" view where the user can:
    - Preview the raw CSV data.
    - Visually map columns (e.g., "Transaction Date", "Description", "Amount") to the standard HisaabFlow fields.
    - Specify the header row and the first data row.
    - Provide a name for the new bank configuration.
- **Dynamic Configuration Saving:** The user can save these settings as a new `.conf` file directly from the UI.
- **Immediate Reload:** Upon saving, the backend will immediately load the new configuration file.
- **Dynamic UI Update:** The frontend will refresh its list of available banks, and the newly created configuration will be automatically selected for the file, allowing the user to proceed with parsing and transformation without restarting the application.

## 5. User Flow

1.  **Launch:** The user opens the HisaabFlow desktop application.
2.  **Upload:** The user drags and drops one or more bank statement CSVs into the application window.
3.  **Configure & Review:**
    *   **For Known Banks:** The system automatically detects the bank and parses the file. The user is presented with a preview of the parsed data.
    *   **For Unknown Banks (Low Confidence):** The file is flagged for manual configuration. The user is directed to the **Advanced Configuration Mode**.
        *   The user maps the columns and saves the new bank configuration.
        *   The system reloads, and the file is parsed using the newly created configuration.
4.  **Transform & Analyze:** The user proceeds to the transformation step. The system cleans the data and runs the transfer detection algorithm.
5.  **Confirm Transfers:** The user reviews potential transfer pairs and manually confirms them.
6.  **Export:** The user exports the final, unified dataset as a single clean CSV file.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The application should be responsive and able to process typical bank statements (hundreds to thousands of rows) within a few seconds.
- **Usability:** The interface must be clean, modern, and intuitive, guiding the user through the workflow with clear instructions and feedback.
- **Security & Privacy:** As a local-first application, it must not make any external network requests with user data. The bundled backend must be sandboxed within the application.
- **Compatibility:** The application must be compatible with the latest versions of Windows, macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), and major Linux distributions (via AppImage).

## 7. Assumptions & Dependencies

- Users have access to their bank statements in CSV format.
- The structure of a bank's CSV export does not change frequently.
- The user's machine has sufficient resources to run a React/Electron application.

## 8. Out of Scope (Future Considerations)

- Direct integration with bank APIs (Plaid, etc.).
- Cloud synchronization or multi-device support.
- Multi-user accounts or collaboration features.
- Advanced data visualization or budgeting features within the app itself.
