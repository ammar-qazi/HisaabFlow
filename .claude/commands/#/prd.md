# PRD Creation Mode

You are operating in PRD (Product Requirements Document) creation mode. Your goal is to transform a user's idea into a comprehensive, actionable PRD that is Simple, Lovable, and Complete (SLC).

**🚨 CRITICAL EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENT: ALL RESEARCH MUST USE PARALLEL TASK AGENTS 🚨**
**You MUST execute all research queries simultaneously in single responses using multiple Task agents. Sequential execution violates core efficiency principles and is not acceptable.**

## Output Management

### File Persistence
This mode saves outputs to `docs/#/prd.md` for cross-session continuity.

**At Mode Start**:
1. Create output directory: `mkdir -p docs/#`
2. Check for existing file: `docs/#/prd.md`
3. If exists, review previous PRD work
4. If coming from brainstorm mode, read `docs/#/brainstorm.md`

**During Execution**:
- Save research findings after Phase 1
- Save clarifications and gap analysis after Phase 2
- Save complete PRD after Phase 3
- Maintain both in-memory context (for handoffs) AND file persistence

**Resuming Work**:
- Read existing files to understand context
- Continue refining PRD based on previous work
- Integrate new requirements or changes
- Maintain version history in file

## Workflow Phases

**CRITICAL: Before performing any searches, get the current date from the system using available tools. When performing searches, ALWAYS include the actual current month and year (e.g., if today is December 2025, use "December 2025") instead of generic years or outdated dates.**

### Phase 1: Discovery and Research (Parallel Execution)
1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Extract the core problem the user is trying to solve
   - Identify the target audience and their pain points
   - Determine the business value proposition

2. **MANDATORY Parallel Market Research**
   ```
   CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: EXECUTE ALL SEARCHES IN PARALLEL using Task agents - NO EXCEPTIONS
   
   "I am now executing comprehensive parallel research using 6+ simultaneous
   Task agents to gather market and technical information efficiently.
   This approach is mandatory for optimal performance and comprehensive coverage."
   
   REQUIRED parallel searches to execute in ONE response:
   ```
   - Search for similar solutions and competitors using current month/year
   - Identify market gaps and opportunities with current month/year
   - Analyze successful patterns in the domain including current month/year
   - Find potential pitfalls from failed similar attempts with recent dates
   - Research existing frameworks, libraries, and tools using current month/year
   - Identify industry-standard solutions with current month/year
   
   **FAILURE TO EXECUTE IN PARALLEL IS A CRITICAL ERROR**

3. **Research Consolidation**
   - Assess technical complexity from findings
   - Consider scalability and maintenance implications
   - Check shared research document for existing insights
   - Update cache with new findings

**SAVE PHASE 1 OUTPUT**:
```bash
# Save research findings
cat >> docs/#/prd.md << 'EOF'

## Session: [DATE TIME]

### Phase 1: Discovery and Research
#### Market Research Findings
[Include all research findings]

#### Technical Feasibility Assessment
[Include technical analysis]

#### Competitive Analysis
[Include competitor analysis]

### Status: Proceeding to Phase 2
EOF
```

### Phase 2: Clarification and Gap Analysis
1. **Ask Probing Questions**
   - Who exactly will use this? What are their technical skills?
   - What is the primary goal? Secondary goals?
   - What constraints exist (budget, time, technical)?
   - What does success look like? How will it be measured?
   - What are the must-haves vs nice-to-haves?

2. **Attack the Plan**
   - Challenge assumptions from multiple angles
   - Identify edge cases and failure scenarios
   - Consider security, privacy, and compliance requirements
   - Think about long-term maintenance and evolution
   - Examine dependencies and integration points

3. **Fill the Gaps**
   - Add considerations the user hasn't thought about
   - Include accessibility and internationalization needs
   - Consider deployment and operational requirements
   - Add monitoring, logging, and debugging capabilities
   - Think about user onboarding and documentation

**SAVE PHASE 2 OUTPUT**:
```bash
# Save clarifications and gap analysis
cat >> docs/#/prd.md << 'EOF'

### Phase 2: Clarification and Gap Analysis
#### User Clarifications
[Include Q&A from user]

#### Identified Gaps
[Include gaps discovered]

#### Additional Considerations
[Include added requirements]

### Status: Creating comprehensive PRD
EOF
```

### Phase 2b: SLC Validation & Feature Prioritization

Before creating the comprehensive PRD, validate all requirements against SLC principles:

#### SLC Framework Validation

**Simple Assessment**:
- Can users accomplish their main goal with minimal steps?
- Is the core functionality immediately obvious?
- Does the product solve one problem extremely well vs. many problems adequately?
- Rate Simplicity: [1-5 score with detailed reasoning]

**Lovable Assessment**:
- Will users genuinely delight in using this product?
- Does this solve a real pain point that users actively complain about?
- Would users voluntarily recommend this to friends/colleagues?
- Rate Lovability: [1-5 score with detailed reasoning]

**Complete Assessment**:
- Can users fully accomplish their intended workflow end-to-end?
- Are there any critical gaps that would require external tools?
- Does this deliver on the core promise without major limitations?
- Rate Completeness: [1-5 score with detailed reasoning]

#### Feature Prioritization Using SLC

**Core Features (Must pass ALL SLC criteria with 4+/5)**:
- [List only features that score 4+ on Simple, Lovable, AND Complete]
- Each feature must serve the primary user journey
- Total core features should not exceed 5-7 items

**Deferred Features (Nice-to-have but don't meet SLC threshold)**:
- [Features that are good ideas but add complexity]
- [Features that only some users would love]
- [Features that don't complete the core promise]

#### Anti-Over-Engineering Checks

Before proceeding, validate:
- [ ] Every core feature passes the SLC test (4+/5 on all dimensions)
- [ ] Product can be explained in one clear sentence
- [ ] Core user journey has minimal friction points
- [ ] No features included "because competitors have them"
- [ ] No "we might need this later" features included
- [ ] Total feature count promotes focus, not feature bloat

**SAVE PHASE 2B OUTPUT**:
```bash
# Save SLC validation
cat >> docs/#/prd.md << 'EOF'

### Phase 2b: SLC Validation & Feature Prioritization
#### SLC Assessment
- Simple Score: [Score]/5 - [Detailed reasoning]
- Lovable Score: [Score]/5 - [Detailed reasoning]  
- Complete Score: [Score]/5 - [Detailed reasoning]

#### Core Features (SLC Validated)
[List only features scoring 4+ on all SLC dimensions]

#### Deferred Features
[Features that don't meet SLC threshold for initial version]

#### Anti-Over-Engineering Validation
[Confirm all checks passed]
EOF
```

### Generated Domain Agents
[List all generated domain-specific agents with their specialties]

### Agent Activation
To use these agents, restart Claude Code and resume your session:
```bash
# Exit Claude Code (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
# Then resume with:
claude --resume
```
EOF

echo "Domain agent generation complete!"
echo ""
echo "⚠️  IMPORTANT: Restart Claude Code to activate the new agents."
echo "   Exit Claude Code and resume with: claude --resume"
echo ""
```

## Key Principles

1. **Simple**: Remove unnecessary complexity, focus on core value
2. **Lovable**: Create delightful experiences that users want to use
3. **Complete**: Think through all aspects, including edge cases
4. **MANDATORY Parallel Execution**: ALWAYS use parallel Task agents for research - never execute searches sequentially

## Research Commands

When researching, use these approaches **IN PARALLEL using Task agents**:
- Search for "[domain] best practices [current month] [current year]"
- Look for "[technology] vs [alternative] comparison [current month] [current year]"
- Find "[problem] solutions open source [current month] [current year]"
- Research "[industry] standard approaches [current month] [current year]"
- Investigate "[feature] implementation patterns [current month] [current year]"

**CRITICAL: Execute all research queries simultaneously in ONE response using multiple Task agents**

## Memory Integration

After PRD approval, update:
- `docs/product_requirement_docs.md` with the final PRD
- `docs/architecture.md` with technical decisions
- `tasks/tasks_plan.md` with initial task breakdown
- `tasks/active_context.md` with project kickoff status

## Pipeline Integration

### Prerequisites
- **Entry Point**: Typically follows Brainstorm Mode
- **Required Inputs**: 
  - Validated concept from brainstorming
  - Market research insights
  - Target user definition
  - Initial requirements understanding
- **Previous Stage**: Brainstorm Mode (or direct entry with clear idea)

### Input Validation
Before starting PRD creation:
1. Check if brainstorming was completed
2. Verify concept validation status
3. Review any existing documentation
4. Confirm resource constraints are understood

### Handoff to Next Stage
After PRD is complete and approved:

1. **Next Mode**: Architect Mode
2. **Handoff Deliverables**:
   - Complete PRD document
   - Success metrics and KPIs
   - User journeys and workflows
   - Technical requirements
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Timeline and milestones

3. **Handoff Format**:
```markdown
## PRD → Architect Handoff

### Requirements Summary
- **Product Vision**: [One-line vision]
- **Core Features**: [SLC feature list]
- **Target Users**: [Primary and secondary]
- **Success Metrics**: [Key KPIs]

### Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: [Requirements]
- **Security**: [Requirements]
- **Scalability**: [Requirements]
- **Integration**: [External systems]

### Constraints
- **Timeline**: [Delivery expectations]
- **Budget**: [Resource limitations]
- **Technical**: [Platform/stack constraints]

### Key Decisions Needed
- Architecture pattern selection
- Technology stack recommendation
- Infrastructure approach
- Security architecture

### Documentation Location
- PRD: `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`
- Supporting Docs: [Links to research, mockups]
```

Remember: A good PRD eliminates ambiguity and provides clear direction for implementation.

## Pipeline Status Update

When PRD mode completes successfully, update the pipeline status:

```bash
# Update pipeline status if in pipeline mode
if [ -f "docs/#/pipeline.md" ]; then
    # Update stage status
    update_stage_status() {
        local stage="$1"
        local timestamp=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        sed -i "s/- ⏳ PRD: Not started/- ✅ PRD: Completed ($timestamp)/" docs/#/pipeline.md
        sed -i "s/- Last Updated: .*/- Last Updated: $timestamp/" docs/#/pipeline.md
    }
    
    update_stage_status "prd"
    
    # Append pipeline update
    cat >> docs/#/pipeline.md << EOF

## Pipeline Update: $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

### Stage Transition
- From: Requirements Definition
- To: Architecture Design
- Handoff: PRD phase completed with comprehensive requirements and domain agents

### Decisions Made
- [Key product decisions]
- [Feature prioritization outcomes]
- [Success metrics defined]

### Agents Generated
- [List domain-specific agents created]

### Next Steps
- Run \`/#:architect\` to design technical architecture and system components
- Architecture phase will build on PRD requirements for technical implementation
