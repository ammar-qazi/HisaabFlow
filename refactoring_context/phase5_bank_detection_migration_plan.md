# Phase 5: Bank Detection Clean Architecture Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

Bank detection module migration from `backend/bank_detection/` to `backend/core/bank_detection/` to achieve clean architecture compliance. This is a **LOW-RISK** migration as the existing implementation is already well-designed and follows clean architecture principles.

**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes  
**Risk Level**: Very Low  
**Impact**: High architectural consistency, zero functionality loss

---

## Current State Analysis

### Excellent Foundation
The bank detection module is already in exceptional architectural state:
- **✅ Single Responsibility**: Focused solely on bank detection logic
- **✅ Clean Dependencies**: Proper dependency injection with `UnifiedConfigService`
- **✅ Well-Designed API**: Clear public interface with Pydantic models
- **✅ Comprehensive Logic**: Robust filename, content, and header matching algorithms
- **✅ No Code Duplication**: Single implementation, no redundancy
- **✅ Domain Purity**: Business logic separated from infrastructure concerns

### Current Structure
```
backend/bank_detection/
├── __init__.py           # Clean API export
└── bank_detector.py      # Main BankDetector class (285 lines)
```

### Integration Points (7 files)
**Core Services:**
- `backend/core/csv_processing/csv_processing_service.py`
- `backend/core/data_transformation/cashew_transformation_service.py`
- `backend/services/preview_service.py`
- `backend/services/parsing_service.py`
- `backend/services/transformation_service.py`

**Current Import Pattern:**
```python
from backend.bank_detection import BankDetector
```

## Clean Architecture Migration Strategy

### Phase 5A: Directory Migration (10 minutes)
**Objective**: Move module to clean architecture location

**Actions:**
```bash
# Create target directory structure
mkdir -p backend/core/bank_detection

# Move existing files
mv backend/bank_detection/__init__.py backend/core/bank_detection/
mv backend/bank_detection/bank_detector.py backend/core/bank_detection/

# Remove old directory
rmdir backend/bank_detection
```

**Validation:**
```bash
# Verify structure
ls -la backend/core/bank_detection/
```

### Phase 5B: Import Path Updates (20 minutes)
**Objective**: Update all import statements to use new path

**Files to Update:**
1. `backend/core/csv_processing/csv_processing_service.py`
2. `backend/core/data_transformation/cashew_transformation_service.py` 
3. `backend/services/preview_service.py`
4. `backend/services/parsing_service.py`
5. `backend/services/transformation_service.py`

**Import Change Pattern:**
```python
# FROM:
from backend.bank_detection import BankDetector

# TO:
from backend.core.bank_detection import BankDetector
```

**Systematic Update Process:**
- Update each file individually
- Verify imports resolve correctly after each change
- Test functionality preservation

### Phase 5C: Architecture Validation (10 minutes)
**Objective**: Ensure clean architecture compliance

**Validation Points:**
1. **Domain Logic Isolation**: Verify no infrastructure dependencies
2. **Dependency Injection**: Confirm proper config service integration
3. **Clean Boundaries**: Validate separation of concerns
4. **API Consistency**: Ensure public interface unchanged

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Test import resolution
source backend/venv/bin/activate && PYTHONPATH=. python -c "
from backend.core.bank_detection import BankDetector
from backend.shared.config.unified_config_service import get_unified_config_service
detector = BankDetector(get_unified_config_service())
print('✅ Bank detection imports working')
"
```

### Phase 5D: Integration Testing (5 minutes)
**Objective**: Comprehensive functionality validation

**Test Suite:**
```bash
# Run bank detection specific tests
source backend/venv/bin/activate && PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/integration/test_multi_bank_regression.py -k bank_detection -v

# Full integration test
source backend/venv/bin/activate && PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

## Implementation Details

### Clean Architecture Compliance

**Domain Layer (backend/core/bank_detection/)**
- **BankDetector**: Pure domain logic for bank identification
- **No Infrastructure Dependencies**: All file system access through config service
- **Business Rules**: Encapsulated detection algorithms and confidence scoring

**Dependency Flow**
```
Services → Core/BankDetection → Shared/Config → Infrastructure
```

**Interface Design**
```python
class BankDetector:
    def __init__(self, config_service: UnifiedConfigService)
    def detect_bank(self, filename: str, content: str) -> BankDetectionResult
    def detect_from_headers(self, headers: List[str]) -> BankDetectionResult
```

### Migration Benefits

**Architectural Consistency**
- Bank detection follows same pattern as other core modules
- Clear separation between domain and infrastructure
- Predictable location for developers

**Maintainability**
- Single location for all bank detection logic
- Clean dependencies and interfaces
- Easy to test and modify

**Project Compliance**
- Follows "One Way" principle (single bank detection path)
- No defensive fallbacks or redundant implementations
- Simple architecture over complex alternatives

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risk Level: VERY LOW
**Reasons:**
1. **Existing Quality**: Current implementation is already excellent
2. **Simple Migration**: Just directory move + import updates
3. **No Logic Changes**: Preserve working functionality
4. **Comprehensive Tests**: Existing test coverage validates changes

### Mitigation Strategy
```bash
# Create backup before starting
git add -A && git commit -m "Backup before Phase 5: Bank Detection Migration"

# Incremental validation
# Test after each file update to catch issues early
```

### Rollback Plan
```bash
# If issues arise
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
