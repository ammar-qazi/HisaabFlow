## Description

Optimize the new global state architecture for performance and clean up any remaining legacy code. This includes implementing React performance best practices and removing unused state management code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add React.memo to appropriate components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Implement useMemo and useCallback for expensive operations
- [ ] Optimize context rendering to minimize provider re-renders
- [ ] Remove all unused useState hooks and props from components
- [ ] Clean up legacy handler functions that are no longer needed
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and measurement tools
- [ ] Conduct performance testing with realistic data loads
- [ ] Document performance characteristics and optimization decisions

## Context

Week 4 finalization task ensuring the new architecture is optimized for production use. This completes the state management refactoring project.

## Files to Optimize

- All migrated components for React.memo opportunities
- Context providers for rendering optimization
- Custom hooks for memoization improvements
- Large data processing operations

## Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement React.memo for pure components
- [ ] Add useMemo for expensive calculations
- [ ] Use useCallback for stable function references
- [ ] Optimize context provider rendering
- [ ] Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Add virtualization for large lists
- [ ] Optimize bundle splitting and code loading

## Cleanup Tasks

- [ ] Remove unused useState hooks from all components
- [ ] Delete legacy handler functions
- [ ] Clean up unused props from component interfaces
- [ ] Remove temporary feature flags
- [ ] Update TypeScript types if applicable
- [ ] Clean up test files and mocks

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Measure render performance before and after optimizations
- [ ] Test with large datasets (1000+ transactions)
- [ ] Profile memory usage and identify leaks
- [ ] Test on various devices and browsers
- [ ] Benchmark state update performance
- [ ] Measure bundle size impact

## Success Metrics

- [ ] 40% improvement in render performance
- [ ] 70% reduction in component props
- [ ] 80% elimination of useState calls
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] No performance regressions identified
