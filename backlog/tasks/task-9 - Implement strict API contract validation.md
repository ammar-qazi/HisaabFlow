## Description

Implement strict API contract validation to prevent communication breakages between frontend and backend.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audit all Pydantic models in `backend/api/models.py`
- [ ] Ensure every field has a strict type definition
- [ ] Add `response_model` parameter to every FastAPI route decorator
- [ ] Verify JSON responses strictly match Pydantic models
- [ ] Run comprehensive integration tests to validate all endpoints

## Context

Part of Phase 3 API Stabilization. This enforces strict API contracts to prevent runtime errors.

## Files to Modify

- `backend/api/models.py`
- All endpoint files (`*_endpoints.py`) with FastAPI route decorators
