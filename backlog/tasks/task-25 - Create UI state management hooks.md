## Description

Create custom hooks for UI state management including data table operations, panel visibility, and export functionality. These hooks will eliminate the remaining scattered UI state across components.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `useDataTable` hook for table state (search, sort, filter, pagination)
- [ ] Create `useExport` hook for export operations and state
- [ ] Create `usePanelState` hook for panel visibility (advanced config, expansions)
- [ ] Implement data filtering and sorting logic in hooks
- [ ] Add export format selection and progress tracking
- [ ] Write tests for all UI state operations
- [ ] Add performance optimizations (memoization, debouncing)

## Context

Week 3 task focusing on UI state management. These hooks handle the presentation layer state that affects user interactions and data display.

## Files to Create

- `frontend/src/hooks/useDataTable.js`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useExport.js`
- `frontend/src/hooks/usePanelState.js`
- `frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useDataTable.test.js`
- `frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useExport.test.js`
- `frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/usePanelState.test.js`

## Technical Notes

- Implement debounced search to improve performance
- Use memoization for expensive filtering/sorting operations
- Include pagination logic with proper page boundaries
- Handle export progress and error states
- Provide both controlled and uncontrolled table modes
- Include accessibility considerations for table operations

## UI State to Manage

- Data table: search, sort, filter, pagination
- Panel visibility: advanced config, file expansions, transfer expansions
- Export: format selection, progress tracking, success/error states
- Loading overlays and error messages
- Modal and popup states
