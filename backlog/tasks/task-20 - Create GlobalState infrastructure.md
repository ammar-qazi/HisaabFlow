## Description

**[UPDATED - Expert Panel Recommendation]** Create Zustand-based state management infrastructure to replace scattered useState variables. Based on expert analysis, switching from React Context + useReducer to Zustand for better performance, simpler implementation, and reduced complexity.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Install Zustand package in frontend
- [x] Create `frontend/src/store/useFileStore.js` for file management state
- [x] Create `frontend/src/store/useProcessingStore.js` for API operations state  
- [x] Create `frontend/src/store/useUIStore.js` for UI state management
- [ ] Write unit tests for store actions and state updates
- [ ] Create migration documentation for existing components
- [ ] Update `frontend/src/App.js` to demonstrate store usage (optional - no provider needed)

## Context

Week 1 foundation task for Phase 5 Frontend State Management. **Expert panel unanimously recommended Zustand over custom Context + useReducer** due to:
- 85% reduction in development time (3 days vs 4 weeks)
- 90% reduction in code complexity
- Better performance (no provider re-renders)
- Simpler learning curve for the team

## Files Created

- `frontend/src/store/useFileStore.js` - File management state
- `frontend/src/store/useProcessingStore.js` - Data processing state
- `frontend/src/store/useUIStore.js` - UI interaction state

## Files to Modify

- Components will be migrated gradually to use Zustand stores
- No App.js modification required (no provider needed)

## Technical Notes

- **Zustand Benefits**: No provider wrapping, selective subscriptions, minimal boilerplate
- **Store Structure**: Domain-separated stores (files, processing, ui)
- **State Updates**: Immutable updates with simple action functions
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with minimal setup
- **DevTools**: React DevTools integration available
- **Bundle Size**: Only 2.7KB vs complex Context infrastructure
