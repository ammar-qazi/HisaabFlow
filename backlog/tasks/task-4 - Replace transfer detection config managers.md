## Description

Update all files in `backend/transfer_detection/` to use the UnifiedConfigService instead of the old transfer detection config managers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Update all transfer detection files to use UnifiedConfigService
- [x] Maintain all existing transfer detection functionality
- [x] Run integration tests to verify transfer detection works
- [x] All existing transfer patterns continue to work

## Context

Part of Phase 2 Config Unification. This replaces the old `transfer_detection.config_manager` and `enhanced_config_manager` with the new unified service.

## Files Modified

- ✅ `backend/services/multi_csv_service.py` - Updated to use UnifiedConfigService
- ✅ `backend/transfer_detection/__init__.py` - Removed ConfigurationManager import
- ✅ `backend/api/template_manager.py` - Updated to use UnifiedConfigService
- ✅ `backend/api/config_manager.py` - Updated to use UnifiedConfigService

## Files Removed

- ✅ `backend/transfer_detection/config_manager.py` - Replaced by UnifiedConfigService
- ✅ `backend/transfer_detection/enhanced_config_manager.py` - Replaced by UnifiedConfigService  
- ✅ `backend/transfer_detection/config_loader.py` - No longer needed
- ✅ `backend/transfer_detection/config_models.py` - No longer needed

## Implementation Summary

Successfully migrated all transfer detection components to use the UnifiedConfigService. All tests pass and functionality is maintained. The old config manager implementations have been removed, completing the config unification for Phase 2.
