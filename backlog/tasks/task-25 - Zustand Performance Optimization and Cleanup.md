## Description

**[UPDATED - Zustand Approach]** Optimize the new Zustand-based state architecture for performance and clean up any remaining legacy code. This leverages Zustand's inherent performance benefits while implementing React optimization best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add React.memo to appropriate components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Implement useMemo and useCallback for expensive operations
- [ ] Leverage Zustand's selective subscriptions for optimal performance
- [ ] Remove all unused useState hooks and props from components
- [ ] Clean up legacy handler functions that are no longer needed
- [ ] Add React DevTools integration for Zustand stores
- [ ] Conduct performance testing with realistic data loads
- [ ] Document performance characteristics and optimization decisions

## Context

Week 3 finalization task ensuring the new Zustand architecture is optimized for production use. This completes the state management refactoring project with significant performance advantages.

## Files to Optimize

- All migrated components for React.memo opportunities
- Zustand stores for selective subscription optimization
- Large data processing operations for memoization
- Component render patterns

## Zustand Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement selective store subscriptions for optimal re-renders
- [ ] Add React.memo for pure components
- [ ] Use useMemo for expensive calculations
- [ ] Use useCallback for stable function references
- [ ] Optimize store action patterns
- [ ] Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Add virtualization for large lists (AG-Grid optimization)
- [ ] Configure React DevTools for store inspection

## Cleanup Tasks

- [ ] Remove all unused useState hooks from components
- [ ] Delete legacy handler functions and props drilling
- [ ] Clean up unused props from component interfaces
- [ ] Remove temporary migration code
- [ ] Update component prop types to reflect store usage
- [ ] Clean up test files to use Zustand stores

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Measure render performance before and after Zustand migration
- [ ] Test with large datasets (1000+ transactions)
- [ ] Profile memory usage and verify no leaks
- [ ] Test on various devices and browsers
- [ ] Benchmark state update performance vs previous useState approach
- [ ] Measure bundle size impact (should be smaller with Zustand)

## Zustand-Specific Optimizations

### Store Subscription Patterns
```javascript
// Optimize selective subscriptions
const uploadedFiles = useFileStore(state => state.uploadedFiles)
const activeTab = useFileStore(state => state.activeTab)

// Instead of subscribing to entire store
const { uploadedFiles, activeTab } = useFileStore() // Re-renders on any store change
```

### React DevTools Integration
```javascript
// Add to stores for debugging
import { devtools } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useFileStore = create(
  devtools((set, get) => ({
    // store implementation
  }), { name: 'file-store' })
)
```

## Success Metrics

- [ ] 50% improvement in render performance (better than Context approach)
- [ ] 80% reduction in component props (eliminated props drilling)
- [ ] 90% elimination of useState calls
- [ ] 85% reduction in bundle size for state management code
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] No performance regressions identified
- [ ] Improved React DevTools debugging experience

## Expected Benefits vs Original Context Approach

- **Performance**: 40-60% fewer re-renders due to selective subscriptions
- **Bundle Size**: 70% smaller state management code
- **Development Speed**: 50% faster component development
- **Debugging**: Superior React DevTools integration
- **Maintainability**: 90% less complex state management code
