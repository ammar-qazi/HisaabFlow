## Description

Create specialized hooks for transfer analysis functionality, including transfer confirmation, potential transfer selection, and categorization operations. This handles the most complex state interactions in the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `useTransferAnalysis` hook for transfer operations
- [ ] Implement transfer expansion state management
- [ ] Add potential transfer selection and confirmation logic
- [ ] Include categorization application with optimistic updates
- [ ] Handle transfer analysis data structures and edge cases
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
- [ ] Write tests covering all transfer analysis scenarios
- [ ] Include performance optimizations for large transfer datasets

## Context

Week 4 task creating the most complex hook in the system. Transfer analysis involves complex state interactions, async operations, and optimistic updates.

## Files to Create

- `frontend/src/hooks/useTransferAnalysis.js`
- `frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useTransferAnalysis.test.js`

## Technical Notes

- Handle multiple transfer analysis data formats from backend
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Include rollback logic for failed operations
- Use Set for efficient selection tracking
- Implement proper memoization for expensive operations
- Handle race conditions in async operations

## Transfer Analysis Features

- Transfer pair expansion/collapse state
- Potential transfer selection and bulk operations
- Manual transfer confirmation workflow
- Categorization application with backend sync
- Transfer confidence scoring and filtering
- Currency conversion handling

## Error Handling

- Network failures during categorization
- Invalid transfer data formats
- Conflicting transfer confirmations
- Backend validation errors
- Optimistic update rollbacks
