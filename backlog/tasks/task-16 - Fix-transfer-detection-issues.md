## Description

Address any remaining transfer detection issues that may prevent cross-bank transfer matching.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Investigate transfer detection functionality
- [x] Fix any issues with "Total 0 available_outgoing transactions to process"
- [x] Ensure cross-bank transfer pattern matching works correctly
- [x] Verify currency conversion transfers are detected
- [x] Run transfer detection tests to validate fixes

## Completion Summary

**Completed on**: 2025-07-09

**Work Done**:
- Fixed frontend transfer detection display issues showing "No transfer pairs detected"
- Resolved data structure mismatch between backend response and frontend expectations
- Enhanced transaction cleaning to preserve essential display fields for transfer pairs
- Added comprehensive debugging and logging to transfer detection workflow
- Verified transfer detection backend is working correctly (detecting 1 transfer pair with 90% confidence)

**Key Fixes**:
- Updated `TransferAnalysis` model to include `transfers` field expected by frontend
- Added `outgoing` and `incoming` fields to `TransferMatch` model for frontend compatibility
- Enhanced `_clean_single_transaction()` method to preserve `Date`, `Account`, `Amount`, `Title` fields
- Fixed frontend display showing actual account names, dates, amounts, and descriptions
- Transfer pairs now display correctly: "TransferWise → Revolut USD" with proper transaction details

**Evidence of Success**:
- Backend logs show successful transfer detection: "Applied 'Balance Correction' category and updated notes for 2 transactions"
- Frontend displays detected transfer pairs with 90% confidence rating
- Transfer analysis shows proper cross-bank matching (TransferWise ↔ Revolut USD)
- All essential transaction data (accounts, dates, amounts, descriptions) now display correctly
