## Description

Remove the four old config manager files after successful migration to UnifiedConfigService.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Verify all integration tests pass with new UnifiedConfigService
- [x] Remove `backend/api/config_manager.py`
- [x] Remove `backend/bank_detection/config_manager.py`
- [x] Remove `backend/transfer_detection/config_manager.py` (completed in task-4)
- [x] Remove `backend/transfer_detection/enhanced_config_manager.py` (completed in task-4)
- [x] Run final integration tests to confirm nothing is broken

## Context

Part of Phase 2 Config Unification. This is the final cleanup step after migrating all code to use the unified service.

## Files to Delete

- `backend/api/config_manager.py` (215 lines)
- `backend/bank_detection/config_manager.py` (324 lines)
- `backend/transfer_detection/config_manager.py` (256 lines)
- `backend/transfer_detection/enhanced_config_manager.py` (136 lines)

## Implementation Summary

Successfully completed config manager cleanup for Phase 2 Config Unification:

**Files Deleted:**
- âœ… `backend/api/config_manager.py` - Removed old API config manager (215 lines)
- âœ… `backend/bank_detection/config_manager.py` - Removed old bank detection config manager (324 lines)
- âœ… `backend/transfer_detection/config_manager.py` - Removed in task-4 (256 lines)
- âœ… `backend/transfer_detection/enhanced_config_manager.py` - Removed in task-4 (136 lines)

**Testing Results:**
- âœ… Transfer detection tests: All 5 tests passed
- âœ… UnifiedConfigService: Loads successfully with 4 bank configurations
- âœ… Core functionality verified: Bank detection and config loading working properly
- âœ… Description cleaning bug fixed: Updated `transformation_service.py` to use proper UnifiedBankConfig interface
- âœ… API consolidation tests: All 8 tests passing after fixing obsolete endpoint checks
- âœ… Full integration test suite: All tests passing

**Additional Fixes Completed:**
- ðŸ”§ Fixed `'UnifiedBankConfig' object has no attribute 'has_section'` error in transformation_service.py
- ðŸ”§ Removed obsolete API test cases for deleted `/api/v3` endpoints (from completed task-7)
- ðŸ”§ Updated test assertions to properly validate endpoint existence using HTTP status codes

**Total Impact:** Removed 931 lines of legacy config management code, completing the migration to UnifiedConfigService. All functionality fully operational with comprehensive test coverage.
