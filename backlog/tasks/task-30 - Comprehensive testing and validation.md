## Description

Conduct comprehensive testing of the new global state management system to ensure all functionality works correctly and performance targets are met. This validates the success of the entire refactoring project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Execute full end-to-end testing of all user workflows
- [ ] Validate all 26 original useState variables have been successfully migrated
- [ ] Confirm no functionality has been lost or broken
- [ ] Verify performance improvements meet target metrics
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases thoroughly
- [ ] Validate accessibility features still work correctly
- [ ] Confirm responsive design is maintained
- [ ] Test with various data scenarios and edge cases

## Context

Final validation task for Phase 5 Frontend State Management. This ensures the refactoring project is successful and ready for production.

## Testing Categories

### Unit Testing
- [ ] All custom hooks function correctly
- [ ] Reducers handle all action types properly
- [ ] Action creators generate correct actions
- [ ] Selectors return expected data
- [ ] Error handling works as expected

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Component-hook integration works correctly
- [ ] Context providers share state properly
- [ ] Cross-component state synchronization
- [ ] API integration with new state structure
- [ ] File upload to export complete workflow

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Complete user journey from file upload to export
- [ ] Error scenarios and recovery workflows
- [ ] Multi-file processing scenarios
- [ ] Transfer analysis and confirmation workflow
- [ ] Configuration and template application

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Render performance meets 40% improvement target
- [ ] Memory usage is stable with no leaks
- [ ] Large dataset handling (1000+ transactions)
- [ ] State update performance is acceptable
- [ ] Bundle size impact is minimal

## Validation Checklist

### Functionality Validation
- [ ] File upload and management works
- [ ] Drag and drop operations function
- [ ] Auto-parsing and configuration work
- [ ] Manual configuration overrides work
- [ ] Transfer analysis displays correctly
- [ ] Transfer confirmation functions
- [ ] Data table operations work (sort, filter, search)
- [ ] Export functionality generates correct files

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Props reduced by 70% (15-20 to 5-8 per component)
- [ ] useState calls reduced by 80% (26 to 5 total)
- [ ] Render performance improved by 40%
- [ ] No performance regressions detected

### Architecture Validation
- [ ] No props drilling beyond 2 levels
- [ ] Single source of truth for all state
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Maintainable and scalable code structure

## Risk Assessment

- [ ] Identify any remaining technical debt
- [ ] Document known limitations or edge cases
- [ ] Plan for future scalability needs
- [ ] Assess rollback procedures if needed
