## Description

Create custom hooks for processing operations (parsing, transformation, transfer analysis) and configuration management. These hooks will encapsulate the complex business logic for data processing workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `useProcessing` hook for parsing and transformation operations
- [ ] Create `useConfiguration` hook for templates and bank mapping
- [ ] Implement async operation handling with loading states
- [ ] Add error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Include transfer analysis and manual confirmation logic
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests covering all processing scenarios
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types and documentation

## Context

Week 2 task focusing on the core business logic hooks. These hooks manage the most complex state in the application - the data processing pipeline.

## Files to Create

- `frontend/src/hooks/useProcessing.js`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useConfiguration.js`
- `frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useProcessing.test.js`
- `frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useConfiguration.test.js`

## Technical Notes

- Handle async operations with proper loading/error states
- Include retry logic for failed operations
- Provide both individual and batch processing operations
- Ensure proper cleanup of async operations
- Include optimistic updates where appropriate
- Handle race conditions in processing pipeline

## Business Logic to Include

- File parsing with configuration application
- Data transformation and transfer analysis
- Template loading and bank detection
- Manual transfer confirmation
- Configuration updates and previews
